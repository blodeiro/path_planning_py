# Path planning
A package with a Robot class able to navigate through a list of waypoints.
## Contents:
- Example of implementation with user input for defining the ideal path.
- Geometric functions for calculating poses and the steps of the robot are provided as independent block to help rehusability of the code.
- Unit tests for geometric functions and Robot class.
## Visualization
Matplotlib is used to represent the ideal path versus de real path taking into account the maximun length of the steps and the accuracy of the robot.
